## Features
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and nth root
* Nested parentheses support
* Integers and decimals

## Requirements
* CMake
* Windows SDK Version 10
* Visual Studio 16 2019
* Elements C++ GUI library https://github.com/cycfi/elements

## Build
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/javierramoss/Calculator.git
```
2. cd to the Calculator folder and create a `build` folder.
3. cd to the `build` folder and open the command prompt.
4. Compile using (change the `DELEMENTS_ROOT` path to where the elements library resides):
```
cmake -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -DELEMENTS_ROOT=”../elements” ../
```
5. cd to the lib folder and use the following commands to import the LinkedLib library to the project:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
6. Go back to the main folder and open the `Calculator.sln` in Visual Studio.
7. Add the calculator.cpp file to the solution under source files if not present.
8. Remove all the solutions in Visual Studio excepts for `elements` and `calculator`.
9. Build all.

## Usage
Press the buttons or type directly into the display to write an arithmetic operation. To compute the answer simply press the `=` button.
